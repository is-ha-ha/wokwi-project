# wokwi-project
We created a creative, short project on wokwi with esp32, oled and neopixel array of 10.

The Dout of each successive neopixel is connected to the Din of the next
VSS to ground and VDD to power

Other connections as in json file

The project sets a timer of 1 hour for each class and 2 hours for labs in a college.
The neopixel show the percentage of time completed and the oled shows the information about the class such as the class name, class-room number, etc.

An esp32 is used.
